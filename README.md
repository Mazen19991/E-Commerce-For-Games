# E-Commerce-For-Games
## Ecommerce for games website created using ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL Database  (Project Name is weird i know but back when I did it I did not think of the
possiblity of putting it on github :) )


Developed an ASP.NET-powered e-commerce platform for gaming, utilizing Microsoft SQL for database functionality. This project encompassed a user-friendly interface 
featuring popular and recently added games, along with detailed game information and options for direct cart additions or wishlisting. The platform facilitated
streamlined checkouts and included interactive contact and account pages. Additionally, the system incorporated user roles, distinguishing between developer/game
publisher and regular customer users. This endeavor demonstrated my capacity to meld technical skills with user-centric design principles, offering a robust and
tailored digital environment.
